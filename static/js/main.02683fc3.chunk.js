One need only look at the relationship between the Catholic Church and the State during the medieval period, throughout which a mass cultural production of Christian iconography and literature structurally and aesthetically shaped Western institutions that still exist today (Behr). Thus, it is a reasonable assumption that Zen Buddhism had some impact on the social and political dynamics of the East. In this paper, we will look at Chinese Chan and Japanese Zen to explore the dynamics between Zen and the broader socio-political structure. Further, we seek insight from sociological theory to explain why these dynamics may have arised."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"To begin our exploration of social and political Zen influence, we must first frame Zen in reference to the environments it developed in. Broadly, the Zen school is a form of Buddhism which emphasizes practice over scholarly mastership. The origin of what we now refer to broadly as Zen stems back to the creation of Chan Buddhism in China. Chinese Chan focused on expanding Buddhist meditation beyond what was strictly explained in previous texts to essentially all of life. Chan Buddhists greatly emphasized the power of meditation, and its place in the journey towards and the expression of true enlightenment. In the centuries after its development, Chan Buddhism incorporated the idea of nonduality and Buddha-nature (Hershock). Later in this paper, we will discuss how the non-dualistic perception of universal interdependence could lead to a form of conservatism that supports political institutions by means of the interpretation of them as a \u201cnatural\u201d part of the world - accepting their influence rather than denying or fighting against it."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"The Zen Buddhism that we see today has been shaped by a diverse history. When Zen originated as Chan in China, centuries of intermeshing with local folk religions and Confucianism ensued. When Zen appeared in Japan, it had already undergone much prior development in China, and was subsequently infused with the influence of Japanese folk religion and spirituality. Furthermore, during the Meiji Restoration in Japan, a rabid nationalism led to the deliberate distancing of Zen from its Chinese influences and origins. For these reasons, Zen must be analyzed in the context of its locale (Chan-Wyles). In fact, we see partially conflicting political expressions from these two Zen centers in the time leading up to World War II."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"A clear cut example of the relationship between Zen Buddhism and the state is institutional Zen support for Japanese involvement in WW2. The book, Zen at War, documents the support that Zen Buddhist leaders had for holy war. It maintains that Zen support for state militarism stemmed back to the time of the Meiji Restoration - a time when leaders acted in the name of restoring imperial rule and strengthening Japan against the threat of colonization. A famous quote from one Soto Zen Monk states, \u201cIf ordered to march: tramp, tramp, or shoot: bang bang. This is the manifestation of the highest Wisdom [of Enlightenment]\u201d (Tiltenberg). Zen at War further points to a list of factors first outlined by Japanese scholar Ichikawa Hakuges that contribute to Japanese Zen support for militarism. The list includes the subservience of Buddhism to the state, the doctrine as karma as a \u201cmoral justification for social inequality\u201d, the protection of hierarchical social structures, an emphasis on sunyata and selflessness, and the belief in mutual dependency which led modern Japan \u201cto an organic view of the state coupled with a feeling of intimacy towards it\u201d (Victoria). To generalize, Buddhist teachings provided legitimacy to the state in their perception of it as part of the general dharmic order. This acceptance of the state and its influence on the world acted as a form of conservatism which helped solidify the incumbent power structures. Further, the existence of a karmic gradient was used as a justification of inequality and thus as justification for leader authority. Overall, Zen in this context was used to imply the natural preeminence of Japanese power structures and ultimately provide support for nationalism and conquest."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"East Asian Scholar Janine Sawada, further explores the relationship between Japanese Zen and Early Meiji Japan politics by documenting the experiences of Zen Buddhist leaders of the time. One example involves the story of Soyen Shaku, attributed as the \u201cmost visible representative\u201d of Zen Buddhism (Sawada). Soyen was a member of the Rinzai School of Japanese Zen, where practice was focused on zazen meditation, koan, and samu (physical work done with mindfulness). Rinzai Zen has been characterized as martial, and sharp - a school focused on discipline and stringent practice (\u2018What\u2019). Notably, when Soyen was asked by author Tolstoy to condemn war, Soyen refused, concluding that \u201c...sometimes killing and war becomes necessary to defend the values and harmony of the innocent country, race or individual\u201d (Victoria). For Soyen Shaku, it could be hypothesised that the Zen ethos of general dharmic acceptance would have created an aversion to being misaligned to a supposed universal order. Instead, alignment would involve following orders and marching in lockstep with your fellow countrymen, thus embodying the Rinzai praxis of discipline."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"While we can see these various examples of support for the power of existing institutions in Japanese Zen, some Chinese Chan leaders appeared to have different ideas at around the same time. When Chinese Chan activity revived in the 19th and 20th centuries amidst modernist activity, we saw the rise of Chan activism, otherwise known as Humanistic Buddhism. During this time, Chan leaders advocated for solutions to the issues of poverty and social injustice. Yuanying, a Chan master, was noted for preaching in favor of peace. Xuyun, a renowned Chan master, rejected Japanese Zen for its participation in worldly activity including warfare (Campo). While these masters serve as apparent counterexamples to a general Zen support for war, it is difficult to draw conclusions from this period in China, due to the destruction of information in the Cultural Revolution."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"At this point in our exploration, it may be apt to note that these prior anecdotes of the political views of Zen leaders surely do not represent the totality of Zen Buddhist perspective, and may in fact be non-representative. Nevertheless, their views do illustrate some of the potential avenues of Zen thought and should still be examined in a modern lens as a blindspot to Zen teaching which should be noted so as to prevent political exploitation in the future."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"In a sociological analysis, Robert J. Moore presents the thesis that Zen Buddhism constitutes a dereifying perspective of the social world - meaning that Zen Buddhist teachings would lead one to no longer see the social world as a single coherent entity. To arrive at this claim, Moore notes that conversion to Buddhism is radically different from other religions and can not be simply described as resocialization. Instead, conversion requires admission that the faculties through which one perceives the world are underlied by ignorance and delusion. Hence, some sociologists believe that conversion to Buddhism and Yoga consists of desocialization - the unlearning of previously expressed thoughts and behavioral tendencies. (Moore) Through this process of unlearning one breaks away from their preconceived objectification of sensory input and is able to reinterpret things in reality in the context of their broader interdependence. In developing this more nuanced perspective on reality, one breaks free of their desires for certain outcomes, as their dependency on all other factors is revealed. This acceptance is broad, and applies too to the social and political systems one is embedded in. Thus, through dereification, one may become complicit in creating a world where the social and political institutions are unquestioned, granting them power."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"Overall, the complexity of Zen Buddhist culture and teaching does not allow us to make sweeping conclusions about the relationship between Zen and political power. Nevertheless, we can still analyze individual experiences and come up with hypotheses that relate Zen culture back to their expression in the broader social sphere. In doing so, we have been able to see that a Zen background was able to contribute to support for government power and war in Japan's Meiji era. Further, we can hypothesize that the Zen ethos of worldly acceptance could lead to this form of conservatism and support for institutions, and, delving deeper into sociological theory, we can root this outcome as being so produced by the social dereification created by Zen practice and the Buddhist background."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"}),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("br",null),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"Behr, John. \u201cThe First Christian Theologians: An Introduction to Theology in the Early Church.\u201d Journal of Early Christian Studies, vol. 13, no. 2, 2005, pp. 268\u2013270., doi:10.1353/earl.2005.0014."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"Campo, Daniela. \u201cChan Master Xuyun.\u201d Making Saints in Modern China, 2017, pp. 99\u2013136., doi:10.1093/acprof:oso/9780190494568.003.0004."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"Chan-Wyles, Adrian. \u201cThe Differences Between Chinese Ch'an and Japanese Zen in a Nutshell.\u201d The Sangha Kommune, 28 Aug. 2015,  thesanghakommune.org/2015/08/28/the- differences-between-chinese-chan-and-japanese-zen-in-a-nutshell/."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"Hershock, Peter. \u201cChan Buddhism.\u201d Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University, Mar. 2019, plato.stanford.edu/entries/buddhism-chan/."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"Moore, Robert J. \u201cDereification in Zen Buddhism.\u201d The Sociological Quarterly, vol. 36, no. 4, 1995, pp. 699\u2013723., doi:10.1111/j.1533-8525.1995.tb00461.x."),i.a.createElement("p",{className:"essay"},"Sawada, Janine. \u201cPolitical Waves in the Zen Sea: The Engaku-ji Circle in Early Meiji Japan\u201d.
